# Tags
Tags are associated with commits, so you can use a tag to mark an individual point in your repository's history, including a version number for a release.
### How tags can be used in git?
Git Tags are specific reference points in the Git history. Git tags are used to capture the specific point in the history that is further used to point to a released version. A tag does not change like a branch. They don't have a further history of commits after being created.
